<H2>Cloud Architecture</H2>
<H4>Objective</H4>
<P>The objective of this second assignment is to build an application architecture that
demonstrates how serverless functions can be used to build loosely coupled systems</P> </br>
<h4>Core functionality specification</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Propose an application scenario that is suitable for implementation as a serverless architecture </li>
  <li>Complete the lab exercises relating to AWS Lambda, SNS, SQS, DynamoDB and S3 and
combine these cloud services to implement a serverless architecture for your chosen
application scenario to meet these requirements.</li>
<li>. Evaluate your implementation from the perspective of the AWS Well Architected
Framework (WAF) pillars. This evaluation must be in your own words and relate
specifically to your architecture. </li>

</ol>  

<h4>Additional functionality</h4>
<ol>
  <li> AWS Key Managment system for encryption or any file</li>
  <li>Automate the basic specification, or part of it, using the AWS SDK â€“ e.g. Python/boto.</li>
</ol>
